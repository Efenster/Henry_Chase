Mrs Mansfield attends the Mariners Church as often as possible, is much pleased indeed with it, has opened her own door for prayer meetings, and appears anxious about her soul.  I left her a tract. \nI attended prayer meeting in the evening at Mrs. Mansfields 21 Pike Street. Mr. Clark, a sailor, opened the meeting by reading a Psalm from the Bible, which he followed by a prayer and some remarks.  Among other things he exhorted parents to take their children one by one alone, and there talk to them & pray with them.  He was followed by Mr ... a Norwegian & a sailor, who commended by speaking of the sincerity and solemnity with which we should perform our religious exercises, for God is a consuming fire.  He adverted, with much feeling, to his former wickedness when he followed the sea, and frequently prayed to God to snd the ship, cargo, captain and crew, all to the Devil. He said he was scared from the consequences of his own prayers, by the contrary prayers of his friends upon the shore.  After him, Mr. Peter Smith, sailor, spoke a few words and offered up a prayer with much apparent humility and sincerity.  I gave some remarks and closed by prayer.  There were nto many present, but the meeting was very solemn and interesting.  After meeting was closed, a sailor said, 'If you have patience I will sing a few verses,' and then began in a clear shrill musical voice ‘From whence doth this union arise, that hatred is conquered by love, it fastens our souls in such ties, that nature and time can’t remove.'  We then separated, and some left the place with much reluctance.  On my way home I had some conversation with Mr. Smith, who professes lately to have experienced religion.  Sometime last winter on a voyage his mind was solemnly arrested by the fall of two men overboard, one particularly almost with an oath in his mouth, both met a watery grave.  When he arrived home, his mind was yet more powerfully arrested by finding his wife anxious, who, by attending the Mariners Church (under religious exercises) had become anxious about her soul.  A few weeks ago he professes to have found peace, having previously seen himself to be a wretched and undone sinner, justly exposed to hell and deserving to be case off forever.  He now views Jesus Christ as the only Saviour, to whom he has been enabled to flee for refuge,.  I plainly told him the temptations to which he would be exposed, and exhorted him to perseverance and to set a good example before his shipmates, and do all the good he can in the world.  Visits 5.
